# Python Clean Architecture template

A template of python project implementing what we called Clean Architecture 

## Clean Architecture Overview

Clean Architecture, proposed by Robert C. Martin, is a software design philosophy that emphasizes separation of concerns and modularity. It structures the system into distinct layers, ensuring that the core business logic (entities and use cases) is independent of external factors like frameworks, databases, and user interfaces. This design enhances testability, flexibility, and maintainability by allowing external components to be treated as plugins that can be replaced or modified without impacting the core logic.

Key layers include:

- Entities: Core business rules.
- Use Cases: Application-specific logic.
- Interface Adapters: Data conversion between core logic and external systems.
- Frameworks & Drivers: Implementation details like databases and UI.

By adhering to the Dependency Rule—where dependencies point inward towards more abstract layers—Clean Architecture creates resilient systems that are easier to evolve over time.

## Development History

Milestone 1: Project Initiation - [Date: 2024-09-01]
- Set up project structure: Initialized the project with a basic directory layout following Clean Architecture principles.
- Configured version control: Set up Git repository and added .gitignore for Python projects.
- Created README: Drafted the initial version of the README file, including a project overview and development history section.
